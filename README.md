🎯 **About Me**

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering graduate from **Warsaw University of Technology**, passionate about building intelligent systems that blend mechanical, electronic, and software elements.

From robotic hands and embedded control systems to CFD simulation of artificial heart pumps, I’ve worked across domains — always learning, experimenting, and delivering real-world solutions.

🔧 **I specialize in**:
- Embedded programming (C/C++, Python, Microcontrollers)
- Robotics systems integration
- CAD modeling & simulation (ANSYS, Inventor, Simulink)
- Control systems and automation
